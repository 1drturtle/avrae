Additional Automation Support
===============================

There are many spells and actions that have additional functionality that is not explained or detailed in the relevant lookup or ``!help``.  This page is meant to document those quirks and how to use them.

.. _class_feature_dc:

Specifying Class Feature DC Bonuses
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

You can grant bonuses to your class Saving Throw DCs by creating a cvar: ``XDCBonus`` (``WarlockDCBonus``, ``BloodHunterDCBonus``, ``MonkDCBonus``, etc).

This is to account for items such as the Dragonhide Belt, which adds a flat +1/2/3 bonus to the save DC for your class.

.. note::
    ``XDCBonus`` is not generated by the the sheet itself, but is instead set by the user. It will grant the given bonus to the save DC of actions for that class.
    You can set it with ``!cvar XDCBonus #``, such as ``!cvar MonkDCBonus 2``, or with Draconic using :meth:`~aliasing.api.AliasCharacter.set_cvar`.

    This cvar should be an integer, or it could cause the automation to not run.

For more details on implementing this in homebrew, see :any:`class_feature_dc_impl`

Spells with Additional Support
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
.. note::
    ``-choice`` always transforms the argument to lowercase (``-choice FIre`` will be treated as ``-choice fire``), making it case insensitive.

    Additionally, all of the options below use the `in` operator, so you can use partial matches (``-choice fire`` will match ``-choice fireball``)


Absorb Elements
-------------------
You can have the automation automatically apply the damage type resistance you want to absorb using ``-choice [element]`` (``-choice fire`` for instance).

Additionally, you can have the automation heal you for half the damage you absorb by adding ``-amt [amount]`` to the end of the command. (``-amt 5`` for instance). It will half the damage you specify, and heal you for that amount.

You can use both of these together (``-choice fire -amt 5`` for instance).

Alter Self
-----------------
You can specify the type of alteration you want to take with the ``-choice`` argument.

* ``-choice aquaticswimwater`` for the Aquatic Adaptation option
* ``-choice appearancealter`` for the Change Appearance option
* ``-choice naturalweapon`` for the Natural Weapons option


Blindness/Deafness
---------------------
You can specify the type of hindrance you want to apply with the ``-choice`` argument.

* ``-choice blindness`` for the Blindness option
* ``-choice deafness`` for the Deafness option

Eldritch Blast
-----------------
Eldritch Blast has a number of Eldritch Invocations that can affect it. You can add these to your ``invocations`` cvar to have them automatically applied when you cast Eldritch Blast.

If you add ``agonizing blast`` to your ``invocations`` cvar (``!cvar invocations agonizing blast``), it will automatically add your charisma when casting blast now.

Additionally, if you have other (official) invocations that affect blast, you can similarly add those to that cvar (``!cvar invocations agonizing blast, lance of lethargy`` for instance), and it will add reminder text for them as well.

Like ``-choice``, the automation will check against a lowercase version of the cvar, so ``!cvar invocations Agonizing Blast`` will work just as well as ``!cvar invocations agonizing blast``.
